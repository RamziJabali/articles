# Modularization

## Introduction
What is **modularization**?
- This is the practice of breaking down a code base into loosely coupled smaller self containing parts.
- In Android, a project is considered to be multi-module if there is multiple Gradle modules.
Who is **modularization** for?
- It's for everyone who wants their codebase to be broken down into independent pieces that are reusable and self-sustainable.
- In my opinion this becomes a viable option when your codebase is big and hard to maintain.

## Key Points
- **What is Modularization** 
- **Why Modularization Is Important** 
- **Who Modularization Is For**
- **Modularization Terminology & Principles*
- **Modularization Benefits**
- **Modularization Package Structure**
- **Modularization Example**

## 1. What Is Modularization
This is the practice of breaking down a code base into loosely coupled, smaller, self containing parts. Each part being it's own module.

## 2. Why Modularization Is Important
It's important because it allows for your codebase to be broken down into independent reusable pieces called `modules`. 

This then allows these modules easier maintainability and scalability, which in turn extends the same benefits to your codebase.
## 3. Who Is Modularization For
1. **Developers** who want their codebase to be broken down into independent, reusable, and self-sustainable pieces, simplifying debugging, updating, and reusability.
2. **Projects with Complex or Growing Codebases**, where modularization becomes a viable option when the code is large, difficult to maintain, or frequently evolving.

## Modularization Terminology & Principles
- Module:
	- Is a part of your code that has high module cohesion and is decoupled from other modules.
- Module Cohesion:
	- Degree of interaction within your module.
- Module Decoupling:
	- Degree of interaction between modules.
- MAXMIN:
	- Maximal interaction within module, minimal interaction between modules
	- MAX modular cohesion MIN modular coupling
