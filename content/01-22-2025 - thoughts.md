Learning to over come the different shortcomings of Compose Multiplatform have been a bit tedious. Finding solutions and work arounds to issues has been pretty fun. I was glad to be able to create and use `composeResources` a package labeled that way that lives in `commonMain`. I was able to get the resources to be utilized in `commonMain`, but that ended up breaking  previews in Android which is a pretty well known issue.

All in all good work.
