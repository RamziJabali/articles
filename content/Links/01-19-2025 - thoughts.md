It's definitely a lot more challenging than I thought even starting this process. Creating the Github project is definitely a good start, helps me put my thinking into different tickets and allows me to put them within sprints like I wanted.

I do want to want to learn tech I have not really dived to deep in, so this is letting me add in details that previously would have just been in my mind. Giving order to the project with tickets, time scopes, and clear project direction.

A big reason why I like it this way is that I can see how long this all really took for me to do.
