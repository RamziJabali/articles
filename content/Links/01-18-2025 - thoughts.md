I had time on my hand to think about how each component on the screen would be shared. The graph could be a potential issue, as I was previously using a library for it. I might have to dip into learning how to create custom views in compose. The map view would most likely also be an issue, using map box, not knowing if it's cross platform.

All in all, seems like there is a lot of unknowns going into this. But having an idea of what those unknowns are is definitely a step in the right direction.
